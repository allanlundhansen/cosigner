# Cosigner

## Overview

Financial intermediaries in the blockchain industry require a standardised way to interact with multiple blockchain technologies, and a secure way to manage the private keys needed to sign transactions. 
Cosigner introduces a best practice implementation for storing, sending and receiving digital financial instruments with the use of blockchain technology.

## WARNING

Cosigner is in early stages of active development. Until we define RFCs for
Cosigner, the API can and will likely change.

## Code Style

Cosigner will be following Google's
[Java style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

## Usage

See [cosigner-core](https://github.com/EMAXio/cosigner/blob/master/cosigner-core/README.md) for instructions on building and using cosigner.

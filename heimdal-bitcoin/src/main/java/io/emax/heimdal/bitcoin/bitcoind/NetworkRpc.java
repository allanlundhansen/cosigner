/**
 * Network RPCs
 * 
 * AddNode: attempts to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node
 * once. PENDING: GetAddedNodeInfo: returns information about the given added node, or all added
 * nodes (except onetry nodes). Only nodes which have been manually added using the addnode RPC will
 * have their information displayed. PENDING: GetConnectionCount: returns the number of connections
 * to other nodes. PENDING: GetNetTotals: returns information about network traffic, including bytes
 * in, bytes out, and the current time. PENDING: GetNetworkInfo: returns information about the
 * nodeâ€™s connection to the network. New in 0.9.2, Updated in 0.10.0 PENDING: GetPeerInfo: returns
 * data about each connected network node. Updated in 0.10.0 PENDING: Ping: sends a P2P ping message
 * to all connected nodes to measure ping time. Results are provided by the getpeerinfo RPC pingtime
 * and pingwait fields as decimal seconds. The P2P ping message is handled in a queue with all other
 * commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping

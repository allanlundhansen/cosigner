# heimdal

## Overview

There are thousands of different block chains/distributed ledgers, each of them
function technically in slightly different ways. As an exchange however there
are common requirements for the general functionality of each. With Heimdal we
aim to create an open standard for how to implement such a secure and
transparent wallet solution, as a centralized financial institution operating in
the block chain space.

## WARNING

Heimdal is in early stages of active development. Until we define RFCs for
Heimdal, the API can and will likely change.

## Code Style

Heimdal will be following Google's
[Java style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
